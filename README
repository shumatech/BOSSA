BOSSA 1.2 for Arduino Due

This version of BOSSA is a fork of the original project and contains some
patches specific for the Arduino Due product that are unlike to be accepted
upstream.

The original software is developed by Scott Shumate and can be found here:

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
-------------------
* New BOSSA shell command line application to do basic memory, flash, and PIO diagnostics
* Workaround for SAM3U firmware bug
* Fixed a bug with setting boot to flash bit on SAM3 devices

RELEASE NOTES
-------------
* The OS X USB driver detects an Atmel device as a USB modem.  When prompted about a new network interface, click Cancel to continue.
* Some stability issues have been seen with the OS X USB driver using BOSSA.  When running BOSSA a second time to the same Atmel device, the USB driver can lock up causing BOSSA to freeze.  As a workaround, always disconnect and reconnect the Atmel device before running BOSSA again.
* The firmware inside of SAM3U devices has a bug where non-word flash reads return zero instead of the real data.  BOSSA implements a transparent workaround for flash operations that copies flash to SRAM before reading.  Direct reads using the BOSSA shell will see the bug.
* There are reports that the USB controller in some AMD-based systems has difficulty communicating with SAM devices.  The only known workaround is to use a different, preferrably Intel-based, system.
