BOSSA 1.7.0

* Mainline BOSSA has been merged again with Arduino version


BOSSA 1.6.1-arduino

BOSSA 1.5-arduino

* Added Codelite project for easier development and debug.
* Improved support for SAMD21 chip by using existing applet already in use for other devices.
  * Added time count for operations erase, write, read and verify.
  * Added Devices.h for global definitions for each devices.
  * NVMFlash::write() rewritten.
  * Removed some useless functions from 1.4 release.
  * Added a mask for SAMD chipid: DIE and REV bitfields are not taken into account as they may vary in the time without impacting the features.
  * Improved write time performance by a factor of 2x


BOSSA 1.4-arduino

* Added support for SAMD21 chip


BOSSA 1.2

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
* New BOSSA shell command line application to do basic memory, flash, and PIO diagnostics
* Workaround for SAM3U firmware bug
* Fixed a bug with setting boot to flash bit on SAM3 devices

* The OS X USB driver detects an Atmel device as a USB modem.  When prompted about a new network interface, click Cancel to continue.
* Some stability issues have been seen with the OS X USB driver using BOSSA.  When running BOSSA a second time to the same Atmel device, the USB driver can lock up causing BOSSA to freeze.  As a workaround, always disconnect and reconnect the Atmel device before running BOSSA again.
* The firmware inside of SAM3U devices has a bug where non-word flash reads return zero instead of the real data.  BOSSA implements a transparent workaround for flash operations that copies flash to SRAM before reading.  Direct reads using the BOSSA shell will see the bug.
* There are reports that the USB controller in some AMD-based systems has difficulty communicating with SAM devices.  The only known workaround is to use a different, preferrably Intel-based, system.
